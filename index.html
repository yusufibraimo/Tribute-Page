                    <p></p>There's more to life than movies.</p>

                    <p>You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else
                    is just sprinkles on the sundae.</p>

                    <p>My mom was always really healthy and cautious about her diet, so I'm not a big sugar guy.</p>

                    <p>Attitude is attitude, whether you're a West Coast gangster or East Coast gangster, you know?</p>

                    <p>I'm into being a dad, that's where my focus is most of the time. I'm an actor that's my job, but
                    it's not my life. I have a lot of other interests too.</p>

                    <p>I'm a crazy car guy. I've got an airplane hangar full of cars.</p>

                    <p>I want to have the freedom to do whatever I want.</p>

                    <p>When I was younger, the pressure was just being cool. I never thought of myself as a cool guy. I
                    always thought of myself as more of the goofy guy.</p>

                    <p>I've always wanted to race cars, ever since I was a young boy, as I think a lot of guys have.</p>

                    <p>My mom's hot. I mean she's old, but my mom's out of control.</p>
